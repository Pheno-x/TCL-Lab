## What is Tcl?

**Tcl (Tool Command Language)** is a simple, powerful, and embeddable scripting language.  
It was created by John Ousterhout in the late 1980s. Tcl is widely used for:

- **Scripting & automation**: quick prototyping and testing.
- **EDA/Chip design**: popular in FPGA/ASIC flows with tools like Synopsys, Cadence, Xilinx.
- **Networking**: routers and embedded systems.
- **GUI development**: often paired with Tk (Tcl/Tk).

### Key Features
- Very **simple syntax** (everything is a command).
- **Cross-platform** (works on Linux, Windows, macOS).
- **Extensible** (easy to add C/C++ extensions).
- Excellent for **text processing** and **automation**.
