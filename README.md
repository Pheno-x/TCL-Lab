## What is Tcl?

**Tcl (Tool Command Language)** is a simple, powerful, and embeddable scripting language.  
It was created by John Ousterhout in the late 1980s. Tcl is widely used for:

- **Scripting & automation**: quick prototyping and testing  
- **EDA/Chip design**: popular in FPGA/ASIC flows with tools like Synopsys, Cadence, Xilinx  
- **Networking**: routers and embedded systems  
- **GUI development**: often paired with Tk (Tcl/Tk)  

### Key Features
- Very **simple syntax** (everything is a command)  
- **Cross-platform** (Linux, Windows, macOS)  
- **Extensible** (easy to add C/C++ extensions)  
- Excellent for **text processing** and **automation**
